The project about optogenetic fMRI stimulating dorsal raphe serotonin neurons under awake state and anesthetized state.

Findings of the works
- Functional map of serotonergic activation by optogenetics, including reward-related network
- General anesthetics, isoflurane, reverses brain-wide activation by DRN stimulation
- Functional map was correlated with structural density.
- The expression of 5-HT receptors and structural density can explain the functional maps.
- General anesthetics may change receptor response.

Codes are also available from github.
